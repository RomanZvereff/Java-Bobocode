Improve your *Spring ApplicationContext* Java configuration skills
### Task
The task is to **refactor Java configuration class `RootConfig`, in order to properly use Inter-bean dependencies.** 
Your job is to follow the instructions in the *todo* section and **implement 
a proper configuration.**  

To verify your configuration, run `RootConfigContextTest.java` and `RootConfigHacksTest.java`

 
### Pre-conditions :heavy_exclamation_mark:
You're supposed to be familiar with *Spring IoC* and *Dependency injection* and Proxy pattern

### How to start :question:
* Just clone the repository and start implementing the **todo** section, verify your changes by running tests
* If you don't have enough knowledge about this domain, check out the [links below](#related-materials-information_source)
* Don't worry if you got stuck, checkout the **exercise/completed** branch and see the final implementation
